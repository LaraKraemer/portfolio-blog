                    I am a former people manager and tech recruiter
                    who switched careers to become a software engineer.
                    My interest in software engineering began while working as a tech
                    recruiter. However, only in January 2024, I began exploring programming
                    for real. The book "A Smarter Way to Learn Python" captivated me, and
                    I started coding every day. Beginning of July, I finalised a Python Udemy Bootcamp.
                    Now, I'm working on an IOT project and this portfolio-blog page with Django. End of August
                    I will participate in the 42 Berlin Piscine.
