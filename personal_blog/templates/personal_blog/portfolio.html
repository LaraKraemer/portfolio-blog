                            I am a former people manager and tech recruiter
                            who switched careers to become a software engineer.
                            My interest in software engineering began while working as a tech
                            recruiter. However, only in January 2024, I began exploring programming
                            for real. The book "A Smarter Way to Learn Python" captivated me, and
                            I started coding every day. By the end of March, I left my previous role.

                            I've been programming full-time for several months. I'm also working on
                            an IOT project. I am building a sourdough starter spy with an ESP32 and
                            some funky sensors in MicroPython. Check out my repo. I love geeking out
                              about my code and getting my hands dirty.
